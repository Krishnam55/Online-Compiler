## üë®‚Äçüíº Admin User Management

### Making a User an Admin

1. **Using the makeAdmin script (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   node scripts/makeAdmin.js user@example.com
   ```
   Replace `user@example.com` with the target user's email.

2. **Verifying Admin Status**
   ```bash
   # List all users and their admin status
   node scripts/listUsers.js
   
   # Check a specific user
   node scripts/listUsers.js | grep -A 3 "user@example.com"
   ```

### Default Admin Account
- Email: `admin@example.com`
- Password: Set during first-time setup

### Security Notes
- Keep admin privileges limited to trusted users only
- Regularly review admin users with `node scripts/listUsers.js`
- Never share admin credentials
- Use strong, unique passwords for admin accounts

---

## **How to Fix**

1. **Open `frontend/src/pages/Compiler.jsx`**
2. Make sure the last line is:
   ```js
   export default Compiler;
   ```
   and not just `export { Compiler };` or missing entirely.
